Project Title: Detecting Fake Banknotes Using Machine Learning in Matlab.

In this project, we used Matlab to build a machine learning model that can determine whether banknotes are real or fake. Our approach included incorporating advanced statistical techniques, which helped improve the model's accuracy and reliability in distinguishing counterfeit from genuine currency notes.
